# Vegan Chocolate Chip Tahin Cookies

1. Mix the ingredients:
   - 240 gr 405 flour
   - 6 grams baking powder
   - 3 grams baking soda
   - 8 grams of salt
   - 180 grams brown sugar
   - 65 grams coconut oil
   - 40 grams margarine
   - 1/3 tsp of vanilla
   - 86 grams tahina (sesame paste)
   - 80 +/- 10 grams of water (we add water until it's the right consistency; the type of tahina you use will affect how liquidy your cookies are and thus how much water you'll)
   - choose one:
      - 100 grams "85% bitter chocolate chips" + 60g pecans OR
      - 100 grams "50% bitter chocolate chips" + 60g "85% bitter chocolate chips"
2. Refrigerate 30 minutes
3. Bake for 12 minutes at 175C (350F)


Notes:

- we put the vanilla in the fat while we melt it, then mix everything together.
- the chocolate goes in last so the hot fat won't melt it
- we scoop them out with an ice cream scoop
