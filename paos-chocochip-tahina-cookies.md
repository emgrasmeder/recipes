- 240 gr 405 flour
- 6 grams baking powder
- 3 grams baking soda
- 7 grams salt, maybe 8gr is ok
- 180 grams brown sugar
- 85 grams coconut oil
- 30 grams margarine
- 1/3 tsp of vanilla
- 86 grams tahina (sesame paste)
- 80 +/- 10 grams of water (we add water until it's the right consistency; the type of tahina you use will affect how liquidy your cookies are and thus how much water you'll)

- choose one:
  - 100 grams "85% bitter chocolate chips" + 60g pecans
OR
  - 100 grams "50% bitter chocolate chips" + 60g "85% bitter chocolate chips"

we put the vanilla in the fat while we melt it, then mix everything together. the chocolate goes in last so the hot fat won't melt it.
then freeze/refrigerate them til they're cold before baking

we scoop them out with an ice cream scoop and

- bake for 12-14 minutes at 175C (350F)
