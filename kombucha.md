# Kombucha

## Ingredients 

### For a large batch:

- 3500 ml water
- 18 grams of tea (7 tea bags of english breakfast tea)
- 225 grams sugar

### For a single liter

- 1000 ml water
- 5.2 grams of tea (2 tea bags)
- 65 grams sugar

#### Instructions 

##### First Ferment

- Make the sweet tea in a large, clean container and allow to cool
  - boil water, add tea bags, add sugar, stir, and wait til it cools to room temperature
- Remove 1 scoby and 1 cup of scoby water from the scoby hotel
- Add 1 cup of room-temperature sweet tea into the scoby hotel
- Add the scoby and scoby water to the sweet tea in the large container
- Cover the large container with a clean towel/cheese cloth and allow it to sit for 7-10 days. It will get more vinegary over time.
  - The container should contain: a scoby, scoby water, and sweet tea
- to avoid mold, maybe poke the scoby under the water on day 5

##### Second Ferment

- Pour the contents of your large container into a swing-top sealable glass bottle until it's 60%-70% full
- Add to the bottle some fruit you like.
- Close the bottle and set it aside out of direct sunlight for 3-4 days. The longer, the more vinegary it will become.
- After 3-4 days, you can drink it already or you can store it in the fridge for a while, probably weeks or months.

##### Enjoying

When you open the bottle, it may pop like champagne. You can avoid this by just barely opening the seal, then closing it again and letting the bubbles die down, and repeat bleeding the pressure in this way until you can open it safely.


##### To get the Kombucha Hotel started 

- You can make the hotel by doing the steps of the First Ferment above, and leaving it there. The scoby can live like that for a long time, and as long as you give it some sweet tea every few months it'll be fine. The scoby will multiply over time.

##### Flavors we like to do on the second ferment (for one liter bottle) :

- Half an orange + 1 crushed cardamom pod
- 4-5 strawberries and a sprig of mint
- 10 blueberries + 1 clove (nelken)
- pear + ginger
- cinnamon and apple
- carrot root + tumeric root
- mango
- lemon, agave honey, ginger, sage
- hops
- lemon + cucumber + sage
