# Vegan Sourdough Challah

I keep my starter in the fridge, so maybe this will be wonky for you if your starter lives at room temperature.
I basically: Feed 6 hours before mixing, then mix and braid immediately, then leave it out to grow for 12 hours at room temperature, then bake. 
The times should be approximate. They'll change with your starter strength and the temperature/season. What's important is that the starter at least doubles (reaches its maximum size) after feeding, and the braided loaves double before baking. You mix them all together when the starter doubles, and bake when the braided doughs have doubled. 

## Thursday at Lunch (5 minutes)

1. Add 75g flour and 75g water to your sourdough starter, leave it covered on a counter

## Thursday Before Bed (1 hour)

1. Mix all the ingredients together (5-10 minutes)
   - 150g sourdough starter
   - 170 or 180 grams water
   - 420g type 550 flour
     - (405 flour works fine but needs a bit less water, we've found)
   - 70g vegan butter
   - 8g salt
   - half cup of white cheakpea flour (not besan)
   - 72g raw sugar
     - my theory has been: more sugar than instant/fresh yeast dough, bc the sourdough will eat it all night
2. Knead until it passes the [window test](https://github.com/emgrasmeder/recipes/assets/8107614/955438ae-c920-46d6-9fdf-7b7c9881d0f8) (40 minutes)
3. ([Now would be the time to take the challah if you made a bigger batch](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/recipe/taking-challah/))
4. Braid (5-10 minutes)
5. Egg wash (1-5 minutes)
   - I've been using potato starch + water with a paintbrush to make a vegan egg wash
6. Put the tiny braided challot on their baking sheet/tray in the oven to chill out over night

## Friday Morning, (12 hours later) (30 minutes)

1. Check that the loaves have doubled in size. They should be basically full grown now.
2. Take the challot ouf of the oven
3. Paint them with some more water+starch 
4. Turn on the oven to 190C
5. When the oven is ready, paint them one more time with starchy water, then dress them with e.g. sesame or poppy or everything
6. Bake them for 15-20 minutes.
   - For me, they take longer to brown than real-egg washed challot
