This is the Challah recipe we've been using for a few years, it's always a hit. Recently we've been making it vegan but that recipe isn't stable enough to as the main recipe here. For our current vegan substitutions, see the notes at the bottom.

You'll need: yeast, sugar, water, salt, flour, grease, eggs

### 1. Proof the Yeast:
- 9g (3 tsp) yeast
- 7g sugar (1.5 tsp)
- 120g  (0.5 cup) of water if you use 405 (pastry, i think) flour OR 140g water if you use 550 (bread or all purpose, i think) flour

### 2. Proof water+yeast+sugar 30 minutes. While you wait, in a big bowl mix:
  - 9g (1.75 tsp) salt
  - 480g (4 cups) flour
  - 74g grease (.375 cups) (coconut oil or plant butter is what we use lately, regular butter was what we used before bc we're don't eat meat)
  - 60g (1/3 cup) sugar
  - 2 whole eggs + 1 extra egg yolk (or egg replacement, see below) (save the egg white in the fridge for the egg wash later)

### 3. Mix in the water + yeast + sugar
ideally the yeast has formed some bubbles, just dump it into your big bowl

### 4. Knead it all together until the dough passes the [window test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYNj9FZAbzM). 
if you're in doubt, keep kneading. seriously, keep going, don't get discouraged!

### 5. Put the smooth dough baby into a greased bowl 
(we use butter/coconut oil, olive oil in a pinch)

### 6. Put the dough bowl in the oven with the light on, covered with a wet towel.
Check on it every 30-45 minutes and when it's doubled in size / is swollen and plump, poke your fingers into it a bunch of times and leave it alone in the oven again
### 7. Check on the dough every 30-45 minutes again until it's doubled / plumped again, now take it out and [braid it however you like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5R6DAHI8LA). 
If you're using enough flour for the bracha, now is the last chance to [separate the challah](https://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/363323/jewish/Challah-a-Step-by-Step-Guide.htm)

### 8. After you've braided your challot, do the first egg wash.
I use my fingers for this, don't knock it 'til you've tried it.

### 9. Wait 30 minutes 
(we leave it in the oven with the light on and a damp towel on the rack above)

### 10. Do another layer of egg wash

### 11. Sprinkle on poppy, sesame, everything, as you like

### 12. turn on the oven to 190 degrees celcius
make sure the bread and the towel are not in the oven while you're preheating it

### 13. If everything worked perfectly, your challot will have risen but not yet deflated

### 14. cook for, like, 13-16 minutes
we use a thermometer to check that they're at least 88 degrees celcius in the middle
if they start to brown too soon, you can cover them with aluminium foil or something. we often just slide in a baking sheet above the challot to slow down the heat if they start to look too brown.

Notes, lessons learned, substitutions:

- replacement for 2.5 eggs:
  - 75g water + 30g apple sauce + 5g corn starch
  - 60g chickpea flour + 120g water
- vegan egg wash options:
  - maple syrup or agave, I heat it up on the stove before applying with my fingers. Result is not as smooth or shiny, but is sweeter and has a nice aroma
- Knead the dough until it's smooth and passes the window check
- Once the bread is golden/brown in the oven as you like, cover it with foil to prevent burning but allowing it to keep cooking
- When you put the dough in the bowl for the first rise, using a grease that's solid at room temperature will allow the dough ball to come out easier when it's time to braid
- coconut oil works well but gives the slightest aroma, i wouldn't over think the grease - butter, margerine, coconut oil, we've even used ghee. you get the idea
- when it comes to kneading bread and letting bread rise, don't pay attention to "it should take X minutes", just do it until the consistency is right and the rise is right. it might take 1 hour, it might take 2.5 hours if it's cold in the house, just punch it when it's ready
- i think we double the recipe above and it takes kinda twice as long to cook...
