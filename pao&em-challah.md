This is the Challah recipe we've been using for a few years, it's always a hit. Recently we've been making it vegan but that recipe isn't stable enough to include below. For vegan substitutions, see the notes at the bottom.

### 1. Proof the Yeast:
- 9g yeast
- 7g sugar
- 120g of water if you use 405 (pastry) flour OR 140g water if you use 550 (bread) flour

### 2. Proof water+yeast+sugar 30 minutes. While you wait, in a big bowl mix:
  - 9g salt
  - 480g flour
  - 74g grease (coconut oil is what we use lately, butter was what we used before)
  - 60g sugar
  - 2 whole eggs + 1 extra egg yolk (save the egg white in the fridge for the egg wash later)

### 3. Mix in the water + yeast + sugar
it should be frothy

### 4. Knead it all together until the dough passes the [window test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYNj9FZAbzM). 
if you're in doubt, keep kneading. seriously, keep going, don't get discouraged!

### 5. Put the smooth dough baby into a greased bowl 
(we use butter/coconut oil, olive oil in a pinch)

### 6. Put the dough bowl in the oven with the light on, covered with a wet towel.
Check on it every 30-45 minutes and when it's doubled in size / is swollen and plump, poke your fingers into it a bunch of times and leave it alone in the oven again
### 7. Check on the dough every 30-45 minutes again until it's doubled / plumped again, now take it out and [braid it however you like](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5R6DAHI8LA). 
If you're using enough flour for the bracha, now is the last chance to [separate the challah](https://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/363323/jewish/Challah-a-Step-by-Step-Guide.htm)

### 8. After you've braided your challot, do the first egg wash.
I use my fingers for this, don't knock it 'til you've tried it.

### 9. Wait 30 minutes 
(we leave it in the oven with the light on and a damp towel on the rack above)

### 10. Do another layer of egg wash

### 11. Sprinkle on poppy, sesame, everything, as you like

### 12. turn on the oven to 190 degrees celcius
make sure the bread and the towel are not in the oven

### 13. If everything worked perfectly, your challot will have risen but not yet deflated

### 14. cook for, like, 13-16 minutes
we use a thermometer to check that they're at least 88 degrees celcius 

Notes, lessons learned, substitutions:
- Maple syrup is an OK substitute for egg wash, I heat it up on the stove before applying with my fingers. Result is not as smooth or shiny, but is sweeter and has a nice aroma
- Substituting the 2.5 eggs in the bread, I've done 75g water, 30g apple sauce (or put in a mixer with the water), 10g corn starch and it's been pretty good
- Knead the dough until it's smooth and passes the window check
- Once the bread is golden/brown as you like, cover it with foil to prevent burning but allowing it to keep cooking
- When you put the dough in the bowl, a grease that's solid at room temperature will allow the dough ball to come out easier when it's time to braid
- coconut oil works well but gives the slightest aroma, i wouldn't over think the grease - butter, margerine, coconut oil, we've even used ghee. you get the idea
- when it comes to kneading bread and letting bread rise, don't pay attention to "it should take X minutes", just do it until the consistency is right and the rise is right. it might take 1 hour, it might take 2.5 hours if it's cold in the house, just punch it when it's ready
- i think we double the recipe above and it takes kinda twice as long to cook...
