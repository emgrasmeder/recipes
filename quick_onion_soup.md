# Quick Onion Soup 
#### Serves: Two Bowls Worth

### Background
I made this soup in a squat when I lived in Berlin the first time. We had mostly vegetarian stuff, it was cold and rainy that day, and I love onion soup. You do the math.
The biggest deterrent from making "French Onion Soup" for me has always been the time commitment it can require. In the past I've cooked onion soups for hours. This day I just wanted to *eat*.
I spent a little time looking for quick recipes, but noticed they were all the same as the all the other onion soups I've made, so I just turned on the stovetop and started cooking.

We had some dried thyme, a dying rosemary plant, dried oregano, and an abundance of garlic. I should have use more garlic just because we have too much of it still.

### Cooking It
Put lots of butter in a pan & add heat. In Germany we have butter that's already filled with herbs, but I used some bottom shelf butter made from sunflower seeds. It doesn't matter.
Add garlic & herbs into butter, let it sizzle and cook for a while.
When you get bored of cooking garlic and herbs in butter (should take a few minutes), cut up about as much onion as both of your fists and toss it into the pan.

Let the onions sit still for as long as you can without burning them. If you just stir, they'll cook but not caramelize, and we want them to caramelize. 
Stir the onions when they turn brown (this takes a longer wait than I'm comfortable with, I'm afraid they'll burn!). 
After the first onion stir, put some water in a pot with some (any type of) bullion or use (any type of) stock. Heat.
My stock was salty enough that it was pretty tasty before I even added anything. Maybe you need to salt yours

When the stock is boiling, throw in your cooked and several-times-stirred onions. Pour a modest glass of wine into the soup, wait a while as it boils.

Taste it. Mine was ready to eat at this point, I let it boil for a few more minutes, poured it directly in a bowl, dunked bread in, and ate.
